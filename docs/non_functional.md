This document defines the non-functional requirements (NFRs) for the **Vak LLM Factory**.

-----

### 2. Non-Functional Requirements

#### 2.1 Performance

-   **NFR-PERF-01: Low Overhead:** Configuration parsing should be fast and occur only once (Singleton scope).
-   **NFR-PERF-02: Memory:** Minimal memory footprint for configuration objects.

#### 2.2 Reliability

-   **NFR-REL-01: Validation:** Strict validation of configuration files using Pydantic to prevent runtime errors due to typos or missing fields.
-   **NFR-REL-02: Clear Errors:** Descriptive error messages for configuration issues.

#### 2.3 Usability

-   **NFR-USE-01: DI Integration:** Seamless integration with `dependency-injector` for easy wiring in larger applications.
-   **NFR-USE-02: Type Hinting:** Full type support for better IDE experience.

#### 2.4 Security

-   **NFR-SEC-01: Secret Management:** API keys are read from config but should ideally be loaded from environment variables (future improvement).

#### 2.5 Compatibility

-   **NFR-COMP-01:** Compatible with Python 3.12+.
